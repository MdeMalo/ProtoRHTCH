name: exorehab_mvp
description: |
  A simple mobile prototype for the RehabTech (ExoRehab AI) project.  
  This MVP counts repetitions of a single exercise (such as a squat or arm curl)
  using Google's ML Kit pose detection (powered by MediaPipe) and the device
  camera.  It draws a skeletal overlay on top of the camera feed, calculates
  joint angles and provides textual feedback when a full repetition is
  completed.
